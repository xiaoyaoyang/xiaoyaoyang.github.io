<p>Thanks for visiting! I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Statistics on 2015. Currently, I am interested in data science and all the other interesting tech things. My research interests are in Statistical Predictive Modeling and Natural Language Processing. My extracurricular interests are anything related to music (piano), tennis ,photography and swimming.
